A chess engine that will (eventually) use MCTS, aided with a NN for policy and board evaluation. This will be done in **C++** and accelerated with **CUDA**. Not sure yet whether tree search will be parallelized on GPU such as [Zeta](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Zeta) or traditionally with multiple CPU threads such as in this [paper](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mmueller/ps/enzenberger-mueller-acg12.pdf).

Please let me know if you have any suggestions. üëç
